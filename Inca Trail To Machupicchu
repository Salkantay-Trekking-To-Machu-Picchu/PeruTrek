Inca Trail To Machupicchu 
Have you ever wanted to walk a sacred route? To walk in the footsteps of kings who claimed to be gods among men? Then the Inca Trail is calling your name! This path will take you from the city of Cusco, the jewel of the Incan empire, to the lost city of Machu Picchu. Along the way you will see ever-changing fortuitous mountain landscape melt away into lush jungle filled with a great variety of flora and fauna. This trek is ideal for adventure seekers, couplese, friends, nature lovers, and intrepid travelers.

Hiking the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu is an experience that will truly change your life forever. There are over 40,000 km of inca trails that run all over South America, to the ends of their far reaching empire. This four day hike to the crown jewel of Machu Picchu is considered to be better than all those other thousands of kilometers. In fact, many magazines list this section of the Inca Trail as one of the TOP 5 treks in the world and most certainly the most famous trek of all South America. Along the way, you will be astounded by the complexity of these archeological sites in contrast with the striking beauty of the surrounding hills and valleys. This tour is ideal for those who are hungry for adventure and excitement to walk in the footsteps of our Andean ancestors along the sacred route to Machu Picchu.

The Inca Trail to Machu Picchu is truly an experience like no other! Like the Salkantay Trek, you’ll get to see both archeological ruins and astounding natural beauty. On both, you’ll get to walk along Inca Trails, but unlike the Salkantay, on this trek you’ll have the opportunity to walk along THE Inca Trail. It is one of the most well known journeys in the world. The Inca Trail is well known for its numerous ruins that are scattered along the path. The Salkantay Trek, on the other hand, is renowned for its breathtaking mountains and jungle scenery. Personally, we are fans of the Inca Trail because it gives you the opportunity to explore complex and advanced ruins whilst at the same time taking in the surrounding natural beauty!
